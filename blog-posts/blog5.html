            <h1>The Power of Seeing the Work</h1>

        <p>Have you ever noticed how meetings can make problems sound complicated until you actually go see the work?</p>
        <p>That's the magic of <strong>gemba</strong>, or the place where value is created. Whether it's a production floor, a lab, or an office, the moment you go 
            there and truly <i>see</i> the work, everything changes. You stop hearing about problems; you start understanding them.
        </p>
        <p>A spreadsheet can show numbers. A boardroom can show reports. But only at the gemba can you see the friction points, such as the bottlenecks, the rework, 
            the confusion, the unnecessary complexity that slows everything down. And the most remarkable thing? The people closest to the work almost always know 
            the solutions. They just need leaders who are willing to walk, listen, and learn.
        </p>
        <p>When leaders stay connected to the real work, they don't just collect data. Instead, they collect <i>insight</i>. They remove obstacles instead of barking 
            orders. This simple act of "seeing the work" transforms organizations faster than any software, dashboard, or consultant ever could.
        </p>
        <p>So next time you find yourself buried in reports, close the laptop and take a walk. Ask questions. Watch a process. Listen to the people who live it every day.</p>
        <p>Because <strong>leadership happens at eye level, not PowerPoint level.</strong></p>
