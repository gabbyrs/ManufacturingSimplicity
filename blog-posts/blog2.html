        <h2>Why 5S Matters</h2>
        <p>5S is one of the simplest and most powerful Lean tools. It organizes the workplace so teams can see problems, work efficiently, 
            and keep improvements in place.
        </p>
        <p>The method started in Japan, and each "S" comes from a Japanese word. Here's the original framework:</p>
        <div class="blog2-chart">
            <img src="../images/blog2-chart.PNG" alt="Blog 2 - 5S Chart">
        </div>
        <p>
            Done well, 5S improves safety, quality, and morale while reducing time wasted hunting for tools or information.
        </p>
        <h2>Adding a 6th S: Safety</h2>
        <p>Some Lean purists resist adding more S's. I disagree.</p>
        <p>Safety isn't an "extra". It's a core responsibility. The 6th S serves as a constant reminder to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify hazards during every 5S activity.</li>
            <li>Correct unsafe conditions before they lead to incidents.</li>
            <li>Design improvements that prevent injuries, not just defects.</li>
            <li>It sends a powerful message that lean is not just about profits and that we care for everyone.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When Safety is explicit, teams naturally build it into every decision.</p>
        <h2>Adding a 7th S: Scan</h2>
        <p>Before the first label is printed or the first tool is moved, I ask teams to Scan the area. Think of it as a disciplined pre-game:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Boundaries:</strong> Define exactly which area is in scope.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Gathering:</strong> Measure current conditions: inventory levels, equipment uptime, walking distances.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual Evidence:</strong> Take “before” photos and create spaghetti diagrams to track motion and material flow. 
                Tip: Make sure you mark the spot where each picture is taken from. You will want to take the "after" pictures from the same spots.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety Review:</strong> Note hazards, near-misses. Involve the employees in the area and members of the safety committee.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Scanning grounds the team in facts. When the 5S event is done, you can show clear before-and-after results, making improvements easier to sustain.</p>
        <h2>From 5S to 7S: A Practical Evolution</h2>
        <p>I am personally less concerned about preserving tradition than I am about making the work better.</p>
        <p>Adding Safety and Scan strengthens 5S by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Protecting people first.</li>
            <li>Ensuring improvements are based on real data.</li>
            <li>Building a record that proves the impact of your efforts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Start with the classic 5S. Then add <strong>Safety</strong> and <strong>Scan</strong> to make sure every event protects 
            your people and captures the facts before you improve.</p>
