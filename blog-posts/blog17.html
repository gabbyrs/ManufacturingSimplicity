            <h1>Simplify First, Automate Later</h1>

        <p>Early in my career, I worked in Germany for a company that had just spent millions on a new automated manufacturing line. It was a "beautiful" piece of 
            equipment full of sensors, conveyors, screens, the works. But quickly, they noticed production was slower than before.
        </p>
        <p>When I asked what had happened, the maintenance manager sighed and said,</p>
        <blockquote>"We automated the mess we already had."</blockquote>
        <p>That line has stayed with me ever since.</p>
        <p>Technology doesn't fix chaos. It just moves it faster.</p>
        <h2>Why Automation Isn't the First Step</h2>
        <p>Digital transformation is everywhere, from AI, robotics, dashboards, and IoT. But without simplifying first, automation just becomes a faster way to 
            make the same mistakes.
        </p>
        <p>A process full of waste will stay full of waste, no matter how modern the machinery looks. Before you invest in automation, ask yourself: 
            <i>Is the process simple, stable, and standardized?</i>
        </p>
        <p>If not, automation will only magnify the inefficiencies you already have.</p>
        <h2>Simplify Before You Digitize</h2>
        <p>In Lean, simplicity is not aesthetic; it's strategic. Simplifying before automating means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Removing redundant steps.</li>
            <li>Ensuring consistency, or "robustness".</li>
            <li>Clarifying responsibilities.</li>
            <li>Standardizing materials, layouts, and methods.</li>
            <li>Making abnormalities visible.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you do this first, automation becomes cheaper, smoother, and more reliable. Because now, you're automating clarity, not confusion.</p>
        <h2>Technology Should Serve People, Not Simply Replace Them</h2>
        <p>The best companies don't automate to cut people, they automate to <i>free</i> people. Free them from repetitive, low-value work so they can focus 
            on solving problems, improving flow, and innovating.
        </p>
        <p>When people understand the process deeply, they can design automation that adds real value instead of complexity.</p>
        <p>Automation should enhance human creativity, not bury it under code and cables.</p>
        <h2>A Simple Test Before You Automate</h2>
        <p>Before approving an automation project, ask your team five questions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Can we clearly describe the current process from start to finish?</li>
            <li>Have we eliminated all obvious waste (waiting, overprocessing, rework)?</li>
            <li>Is there a stable standard everyone follows today?</li>
            <li>Do we measure the right things, such as flow, quality, and uptime?</li>
            <li>Will automation make this process simpler to understand, not harder?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you can't answer "yes" to all five, go back to the Gemba and simplify first.</p>
        <h2>Closing Thought</h2>
        <p>Automation is exciting, but it's not a transformation. Transformation begins when people understand their process so well that automation becomes 
            the natural next step, not a desperate shortcut.
        </p>
        <p>So before you connect machines, connect minds. Because <strong>Lean before digital</strong> isn't old-fashioned. It's the only way automation truly works!</p>
