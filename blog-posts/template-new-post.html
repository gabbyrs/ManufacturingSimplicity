        <p>HERE IS WHERE YOU START WRITING THE BLOG</p>
        <p>I AM PUTTING INSTRUCTIONS BELOW ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU NEED FOR ANY OF YOUR POSTS :P</p>


        <h2>use h2 when writing the subheadings!</h2>
        <p>use p when writing the paragraphs. if you want a space between two sentences for example, you need to have 2 separate paragraphs, so use p twice</p>
        <p><strong>write stuff here that you want to have bolded</strong>write other stuff here that does not need to be bolded</p>
        <p>write other stuff here that does not need to be italicized<i>write stuff here that you want to have italicized</i></p>
        <blockquote>use blockquote when you have a quote you want a special effect on, like those on the previously posted linkedin blogs</blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li>use ul and li when you want a list with bullet points. each bullet point needs another li.</li>
            <li>so this would be the second bullet point</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>use ol and li when you want a numbered list, so each number needs another li.</li>
            <li>so this would be 2. whatever you  write</li>
        </ol>
        <p>you can also use <strong></strong> for bolded words inside an li statement, and <i></i> for italicized words inside an li statement</p>
        <p>after you are done writing the blog in the html file, you need to click on "Commit changes...". you can change the auto-generated commit message, if you want.
            you should see that your changes were successful. it takes a few minutes for the changes to reflect on the website, but if you want to check if they have been uploaded, 
            go to the github repository for the website, click on settings, and click on pages. at the top, it should show you when the last update was posted, after you 
            refresh the page. if anything goes wrong with the commit, just let me know, and i'll look at it!
        </p>

        <p>COPY AND PASTE THIS PAGE WHEN STARTING A NEW HTML FILE FOR YOUR BLOG POST AND DELETE EVERYTHING STARTING WITH THE "HERE IS ..." LINE</p>
        <p>MAKE SURE TO CHANGE THE "... - Blog ?" FOR THE BLOG POST NUMBER AT THE TOP, REPLACE THE SRC FOR THE IMAGE WITH THE CORRECT BLOG NUMBER AND ADD THE TITLE
            TO THE RIGHT OF THE -, REPLACE THE "title?" AND "date?" WITH THE CORRECT INFORMATION.
        </p>
        <p>MAKE SURE YOU HAVE UPLOADED THE PICTURE FOR THE BLOG AS A blog?.PNG WITH THE RIGHT NUMBER INSTEAD OF ?. IT MUST BE IN THE images FOLDER</p>
        <p>MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ADDED A LINE IN blogs.html WITH THE LINK TO THE NEW BLOG POST</p>

        <p>you can message me if you have any questions in the future, and you can also look at the previous blogs i uploaded to see how i created them
            to match what you had posted on linkedin
