            <h1>When to Standardize, and When Not To</h1>
            <h3>October 31, 2025</h3>
        </div>
        <p>I once visited a company that had a 20-page procedure on how to label a box. Every font size, color code, and tape type was defined, and every improvement required a committee approval. 
            They had order, but no improvement.
        </p>
        <p>A few months later, I visited another facility where everyone labeled boxes differently. One used a marker, another printed labels, and another added notes on sticky paper. They had freedom, 
            but no consistency.
        </p>
        <p>Both companies were missing the point. <strong>Standardization is a tool for learning, not control.</strong></p>
        <h2>The Purpose of Standardization</h2>
        <p>Standardization doesn't exist solely for freezing a process. It lets you create a <i>baseline</i> for improvement.</p>
        <p>A good standard is like a photograph of the current best-known method, not a law carved in stone. It allows you to measure, compare, and evolve. Without it, every improvement is an accident 
            instead of a system.
        </p>
        <p>So the goal isn't to eliminate variation entirely. It's to understand which variation adds value and which adds chaos.</p>
        <h2>When Standardization Works</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>When the task is repetitive and critical: </strong>consistency matters (e.g., safety checks, calibration, sterile operations).</li>
            <li><strong>When errors are costly: </strong>standard work reduces cognitive load and makes mistakes visible.</li>
            <li><strong>When you're building a foundation for training: </strong>clear standards accelerate onboarding and skill transfer.</li>
            <li><strong>When you want to reveal waste: </strong>standardization exposes abnormal conditions so they can be fixed.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Standards don't remove human judgment. They make it easier to apply it where it counts.</p>
        <h2>When Not to Standardize</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>When creativity or experimentation is the goal: </strong>early-stage R&D, problem-solving sessions, design work.</li>
            <li><strong>When a process is unstable or unknown: </strong>standardizing chaos only locks in waste.</li>
            <li><strong>When ownership is missing: </strong>if people don't help create the standard, they won't sustain it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Over-standardization kills engagement and turns improvement into compliance. The real power lies in <i>knowing when to standardize and when to let people think.</i></p>
        <h2>How to Strike the Balance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Build with people, not for them. </strong>Involve the users of the process in designing the standard.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep it visible and simple. </strong>One page beats ten. A photo beats a paragraph.</li>
            <li><strong>Review it regularly. </strong>Standards are living documents. If they don't evolve, they die.</li>
            <li><strong>Encourage "better way" thinking. </strong>Every standard should invite the question: <i>Can this be improved?</i></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Standardization should feel like a tool for empowerment, not a cage for control.</p>
        <h2>Closing Thought</h2>
        <p>Standardization brings stability. Improvement brings growth. You need both, but never in excess.</p>
        <p>As Taiichi Ohno said,</p>
        <blockquote>"Without standards, there can be no improvement." But also, without improvement, standards don't mean much.</blockquote>
        <p>So ask yourself: <strong>What's one process in your area that's crying for a clear standard, and one that needs more freedom?</strong></p>
