        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            We are an operations and manufacturing consulting practice focused on turning complexity into clarity. 
            Our work spans executive leadership, global operations, and hands-on transformation in manufacturing environments.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
            Over the years, we have learned that most operational problems are not technical. 
            They are rooted in unclear priorities, overloaded systems, and leadership behaviors that unintentionally create noise instead of focus.
            Our work centers on simplification, respect for people, and disciplined execution. When those elements are present, results follow.
        </p>
        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>
            Our background includes:
                •   Executive leadership roles in several manufacturing industries
                •	Leading operational turnarounds in the U.S. and internationally
                •	Deep experience with Lean, continuous improvement, and quality systems
                •	Working directly with leadership teams and shop-floor organizations
        </p>
        <h3>Manufacturing Simplicity exists to help leaders build organizations that are easier to run, easier to improve, and more rewarding to be part of.</h3>
